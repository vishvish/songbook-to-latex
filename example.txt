[E]Intro\\

[G]If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man

[G]You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me[E]

[D]The pleasure is to [C]play, it makes no difference what you say[E]

[D]I don't share your [C]greed, the only card I need is\\

(x2)[E]The Ace Of Spades

Alright\\

[G]Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil,

[G]Going with the flow, it's all a game to me[E]

Sev[D]en or [C]Eleven, snake eyes watching you[E]

[D]Double up or [C]quit, double stakes or splits\\

(x2)[E]The Ace Of Spades\\

[E]You know I'm born to lose, and [D]gamb[E]ling's for fools,

[E]But that's the way I like it babe

[E]I don't wanna live forever [D]---[E]---[D]---[C]---[B]---

[B]And Don't Forget The Joker[E]\\

[G]Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me

[G]Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again[E]

[D]I see it in your [C]eyes, take one look and die[E]

[D]The only thing you [C]see, you know it's gonna be\\

(x2)[E]The Ace Of Spades
